Having refused to support the Dixiecrat secession from the democratic convention against Truman and having gained the reputation as a judge which was both fair and Respectful to blacks, what was to stop him from gaining the governorship?<br><br>He had been beaten. Having spoken out against the Klan terrorist activities, he had no chance to succeed against hardline segregationist John M. Patterson. Four Years later, he was once again running for the governorship. When he talked about good roads and good schools and all those things that have been part of his career, nobody listened. When he shall talk about blacks, they will stomp the floor.",
